\section{Design}
% ========================================
%     Write your Design here
% ========================================

Describe the design methodology clearly and in detail in this chapter, including principle introduction and analysis, the design criteria, alternatives considered, design decisions, and justification for the final design. Highlight the scientific rigor and accuracy of design methodology by introducing the basic principles and methods. In this context, it is necessary to list the equations, simulation methods, and general circuits. Additionally, describe the design in detail and address each major component of your design, including schematics with components, drawings, flowcharts, etc.

Any form of chapter division is acceptable as long as it accurately and clearly describes the design process. For instance, some teams may wish to split this chapter into two: Design Procedure and Design Details.

This template will not automatically update numbering systems for chapters, sections, figures, tables, etc., so keep track of them as you develop and revise the text.

\subsection{[Component or Block]}

To create a section head, go to the Styles gallery under the Home tab and pick Heading 2. It automatically formats as above and creates a table of contents entry (after you click the Update tab).

\subsection{[Subcomponent or subblock]}

To create a subsection head, go to the Styles gallery under the Home tab and pick Heading 3. It automatically formats as above and creates a table of contents entry (after you click the Update tab). Even lower level section heads can be created the same way, but they are likely unnecessary.

Following is a “template” for displayed math. Use the MathType extension of Word to generate your own content, and note the use of the invisible table (no borders) to keep the optional number flush right.

\begin{align}
    \text{EQI} ={}& \sum_{i=1}^{n}{W_j\ast r_{ij}} \\
    \text{EHI} ={}& L_1 \times \text{ESI} + L_2\times \text{EQI} \\
    \text{EE}/\text{EHI} ={}& \beta_0+\beta_1\text{PCG}+\beta_2\text{RGP}+\cdots+\beta_i X_i+ \cdots + \notag\\
            & \beta_9\text{ICWUR}+\beta_{10}\text{ECPG}+\beta{11}\text{WCPG}+\varepsilon_i    
\end{align}
