% ========================================
%         Write your abstract here
% ========================================


The abstract is short (150 words or less) and provides enough of a summary of the report for the reader to decide whether to read the entire document. State very concisely what your device or system does, and the main findings and results of your project. Save background information (e.g., motivation, competitors) for the introduction and design details for the body of the report. Do not give an advertising pitch. Note that the abstract does not appear in the table of contents. (This achieved by stripping out the heading style.)

Note that you can ignore the TOC on next page because it is generated automatically. Work on the body of the report, then hit the Update tab on the TOC and voilà.

When you double-clicked “ECE 445 Template.dotx,” you opened a new, untitled document in Microsoft Word, which has the main components of your final report set up for you. Save the new document, replace the red text and bracketed section heads with your own, insert carefully prepared graphics, follow the guidelines document (“Preparing Your Final Report for ECE 445”), proofread and revise, and you’ll likely end up with a successful report.

Key words: xxxx, xxxx, xxxx
